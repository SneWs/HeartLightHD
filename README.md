# HeartLightHD
This is the result from a 24h GameJam that I attended 22-23rd of May 2015.

The game is a HeartLight clone. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartlight_%28game%29 for details.
It also contains a very very simple level editor and the first three levels.

## NOTES
The code is quite messy and lacks quite a lot in quite a few places, but it does work and you can play it and build your own levels as soon as you've built it yourself :)

## Tech used.
C# with Win2D targeting the Windows modern platform. It can be built for Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 as well as for Windows Phone 8, 8.1 and Windows Mobile 10.

Win2D is an easy-to-use Windows Runtime API for hardware accelerated immediate mode 2D graphics rendering. See https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D for details.

## Have any questions?
Well, any questions you might have, I will provide you with the answer right now. _Use the source, Luke._
